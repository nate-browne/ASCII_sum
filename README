This program is a short script used for calculating hashes according to the
formula used in CSE 12 with Gary Gillespie for the Hashtable assignment. This
script can be invoked from the terminal using either

python ascii_sum_calculator.py

or by saying

./ascii_sum_calculator.py

If the program isn't working properly, use the UNIX command chmod to give all
users execute permissions by saying

chmod ugo+x ascii_sum_calculator.py

The program allows for the user to enter in a table size of 2 or larger, then
uses that given table size to calculate the correct values for strings entered
in. The program finishes execution when EOF is typed (CTRL + D), when a
KeyboardInterrupt signal is sent (CTRL + C), or if the user types q when
prompted for a name to calculate.

The table size can be inputted in octal, hexadecimal, or in decimal,
and the program will convert it to decimal without errors (so all you who like
to use hex are good to go).
