PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
This program uses the hashing formulas provided in CSE 12 at UCSD with Gary
Gillespie for the HashTable assignment (hw6). Finds the ASCII sum, initial
location in the table, increment, and probe sequence for a user entered string
with a user entered table size.
"""


"""
Calculates the ASCII sum of the given string
param: s is the string to calculate
return: the ASCII sum
"""

"""
Finds the initial hash location of the ASCII sum by modding the sum by the size
of the table.
param: a_sum is the ASCII sum of the string to find location for
param: table_size is the size of the table
return: the initial location
"""
def find_init(a_sum, table_size):

  return a_sum % table_size

"""
Finds the incrementor used in finding the probe sequence by modding the sum by
the size of the table minus one and adding one to that total.
param: a_sum is the ASCII sum of the string to find the increment for
param: table_size is the size of the table
return: the increment value
"""
def find_incr(a_sum, table_size):

  return (a_sum % (table_size - 1)) + 1

"""
Finds the probe sequence and saves it into a list. Every value besides the first
is found by adding the previous answer plus the increment total and modding that
sum by the table size.
param: init the number found from init
param: incr the number found from incr
param: table_size is the size of the table
return: a list containing the probe sequence
